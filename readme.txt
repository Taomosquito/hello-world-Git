This directory contains git study tasks such as creating a repository and adding to it this is the standard readme of what is included in a directory to describe what is happening and below is an overview of the inclusions in a bulleted list: 
  * This is a git repository
  * This is used for studying purposes
  * This is part of the lighthouse labs prep course
  * This will be updated as necessary
  * This is the very first readme I have prepared so it may not be fully optimized.
  * This is written with a background in technical writing so it should have a solid foundation but I greatly value feedback.
